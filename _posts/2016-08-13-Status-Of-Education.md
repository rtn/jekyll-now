Mass media beats to the drum that education is on a decline, it is lagging other counties with similar economic outlooks, it is failing, etc; but offers no positive outlook.  Politician seize control and tighten dominance on education administrators in the name of accountability.  School administrator dictates control on parents and students alike rationalizing that their nazis' style control is good for children and the education of the states.  But non have real, positive solution what will truly serve children well.
