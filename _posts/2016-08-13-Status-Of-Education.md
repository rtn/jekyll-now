title:  Status of Education 
---

Mass media beats to the drum that education is on a decline, it is lagging other counties with similar economic outlooks, it is failing, etc; but offers no positive outlook.  Politician seize control and tighten dominance on education administrators in the name of accountability.  School administrator dictates control on parents and students alike rationalizing that school administrators nazis style control is good for children and the education of the states.  But non have real, positive solution what will truly serve children well.

The nature of education, you see, is to create the work force--and industrialization of labor.  Think about it. When school is the industrial complex to produce the work force, it already has a rubber stamp of what piece of pie is most readily availabe.  Can you guess which piece of pie is mostly availalbe for the school to shuffle children into?  Yes, cheap, manual, repetative labor that requires absolutely no thinking and "do what the are told to do"!
